# Project_Summary
The project is focused on developing a predictive model to determine whether a passenger, referred by an existing customer, will make a flight booking. This prediction model utilizes various features including seat comfort, cabin service, travel class, food and beverage options, entertainment services, etc. The model is built using classification techniques in machine learning, enabling it to learn from historical passenger and booking data and provide accurate predictions for new data. This model can be valuable for airlines in targeting marketing campaigns towards potential passengers who are likely to make a flight booking based on a referral from an existing customer.


# Objective

The provided dataset comprises airline reviews spanning from 2016 to 2019, encompassing a wide array of popular airlines worldwide. The data encompasses both multiple choice and free text responses and was collected during the spring of 2019. The primary aim of the analysis is to forecast whether passengers are likely to recommend the airline to their acquaintances.
